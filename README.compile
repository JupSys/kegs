KEGS is easy to compile.  Just cd to the src directory and type "make".
KEGS requires perl installed in /usr/local/bin/perl (or just edit the
scripts to point to wherever you installed perl).  Perl version 4 or 5 is
fine.

I build KEGS using a complex build process, so the provided Makefile
has no dependency info or other usual makefile niceties.  Sorry.
If you change header files, you'll probably have to erase all the *.o's
and then remake.
