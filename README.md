Kent's Emulated GS Apple //GS Emulator

(Git repositoy with the blessing of Kent Dickey)

This is a git repository of all of the releases of Kent's 
Emulated GS after 0.30.  Previous to 0.30, the code was
called "sim65" and was HP-PA assembly only, and is not 
included here.

Kent's sourceforge site can be found here:
[Kent's Emulated  GS](http://kegs.sourceforge.net/)

Kent was kind enough to provide all of the tar's for the
releases under the condition that I release publicly any
script that I used for importing the data.  The script
I created is a total hack but can be found in the tools 
directory (with a nod to the FTA -- "Winners don't use tools") 
It should be wholely uninteresting given that you are currently 
looking at the resulting git repository.

I will attempt to keep the main repository up to date
with the latest from Kent, including this README file.
Each release that Kent makes is tagged with the contents 
of his tar.gz release, and the tag'd versions will not contain 
any extras (like this file or the tools directory).
