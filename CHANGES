Changes in KEGS v0.36 since v0.35

- Linux x86 port completed and functional with help from Karl Pfleger
- Linux clock fixes--should handle daylight savings better on Linux
- LITTLE_ENDIAN defines
- Start making fixes for NeXTStep due to Eric Sunshine
- Fixed bug in HP asm code with I/O fetches--caused //gs selftests to fail
  and a bug in scc.c was also causing self-tests to fail.

Changes in KEGS v0.35 since v0.34

- engine_c.c fully implemented--KEGS now has a version completely written
   in C, and now portable to other Unix machines.
- KEGS got another 5% faster with more tweaks to the asm dispatch loop.

Changes in KEGS v0.34 since v0.33

- KEGS is 10-15% faster due to finally implementing a planned recoding
   of the dispatch loop.

Changes in KEGS v0.33 since v0.32

- Fixed bug in engine_s.s that prevented compiling on pre-10.20 systems.
- ADB mouse interrupts work now.  Fixed "bug" where GSHK would think
   mouse button was depressed at startup. (GS/OS is looking at mouse
   button 1 status, which accidentally was reading as down).
- ADB emulation of read char_sets and read_kbd_layouts now matches a real
   //gs.
- optimization to allow dereferencing page_info[] even if BANK_IO is set,
   to get a small speed improvement in engines_s:dispatch().
- SCC logs are 'Z' at the disas prompt.
- Tool decoded is 'T' at the disas prompt.
- SCC changes to support slot 1 == port 6501 and slot 2 == port 6502,
   with limited interrupt support.  Most serial tasks won't work still,
   but some do.  PR#1/2 and IN#1/2 work fine.  getty under GNO doesn't.
- -audio [0/1] forces audio off/on.  This just stops the sound playing--
   internally all Ensoniq interrupts/etc are fully emulated.  If display
   is not using shared memory (i.e., it's remote), audio defaults to off.
   (but can be forced on with -audio 1).
- -display {foo} sends X display to {foo}.

Changes in KEGS v0.32 since v0.31

- Faster dispatch loop, for a 10-15% overall performance improvement
- Fixed sound bug where Oversampler would make KEGS halt (Oversampler
   said turn on 128 oscillators, and KEGS tried to...)
- Fixed bug where KEGS would not work on 24-bit displays due to a typo.
- Added frame skipping support (-skip n) and auto frame skipping if you
   are not using shared memory (like displaying KEGS to a remote machine).
- Added -noshm support for forcing off shared memory, so you can see how
   much it helps.

Changes in KEGS v0.31 since v0.30

- New mouse handling--Press F8 to hide X windows cursor and constrain
	cursor inside window.  Makes using the mouse much easier.
	F8 toggles back to normal.
- Add revision to status area.
- Remove "slow memory" calculation.  KEGS was emulating slowing down to
	1MHz to write to slow memory (bank $E0 or $E1).  But true //gs
	accelerators have a smarter trick, so I just removed it from
	KEGS.  KEGS still slows down for I/O reads and writes.
	This eliminates the confusing 40MHz speed numbers you'd sometimes get.
	KEGS can also now run faster when it would have slowed down to
	1MHz before.
- Turn off accurate IWM emulation be default, for much faster emulation.
	Bit copiers won't work by default now.  Toggle accurate IWM
	with F7.  Accurate IWM forces 1MHz speed for 5.25" and 2.5MHz for
	3.5", but less accurate IWM runs as fast as possible.
- Add optional size to s7dx entries in disk_conf, to allow using /dev/rfloppy.
- Allow mounting partitions by number, instead of just by name, since some
	Mac-formatted Zip disks don't have partition names.
- Add -ignbadacc to ignore bad memory accesses.
- Increase MAX_C030_TIMES.  Otherwise, fast workstations could generate too
	many clicks per VBL, causing an assertion to fail.
- Small speed increase detecting changes in the superhires screen.
- Alt_L is now Open-Apple, and Alt_R is Closed-Apple.
- KEGS now uses just one private colormap, so xwd can get screendumps.
